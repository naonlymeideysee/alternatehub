            A Historic Encounter This final marks the first-ever competitive meeting between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan,
             making it a historic clash in European football. PSG, aiming for their maiden Champions League title,
              have previously reached the final in 2020 but were defeated by Bayern Munich. Inter Milan, on the other hand, 
              are seeking their fourth European Cup/Champions League title, with their last triumph dating back to 2010. 
              ðŸ”¥ Team Profiles Paris Saint-Germain (PSG): Under the guidance of manager Luis Enrique, 
              PSG have undergone a transformation, focusing on a cohesive team dynamic rather than relying solely on star power. 
            Their journey to the final has been impressive, with notable victories over Arsenal and Aston Villa.
